## What's it is ?
Hi it's my documentation Markdwon web view, I will put anything I have learned or I want to show on this website.

And I use [docsify](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify) A magical documentation site generator,to build this thing.
In this case, it can help me to build an Static website in a very short time, you can use nginx proxy pass to put it on your server, or just using the GitHub Page to show it, like me.
